# Linear-Regression-Scratch
 Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.
 There are two type of linear regression.
 1.Simple Linear Regresson 
 2.Multiple Linear Regression
 The word Linear in Linear Regression suggests that the function used for the prediction is a linear function. 
 This function can be represented as shown below:
                    Y=mx+c
 
 m = cov(x, y) / var(x)
 
 c = mean(y) â€” m * mean(x)
 
 We will learn to write the algorithm from scratch
